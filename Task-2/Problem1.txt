This program gives output ‘TRUE’ if a given number is divisible by 3 and ‘FALSE’ otherwise, without using the ‘%’  operator explicitly.
BEGIN

 	DECLARE integers N,d,q,r
	get input from the user for N
	initialize q to zero
	initialize r to N 
	initialize d to three
	WHILE r greater than equal to d ,DO
		subtract d from r
		increment q to one
	IF r is equal to zero 
		PRINT “TRUE”
	ELSE 
		PRINT “FALSE”
